    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The warnings module is imported to handle warning messages.\n",
    "2. The warnings.filterwarnings() function is used to suppress specific warning messages. The category parameter specifies the type of warning to be ignored, and the module parameter specifies the module from which the warning is raised.\n",
    "3. The if statement checks if the length of the command-line arguments (sys.argv) is less than 2. If so, it raises a ValueError with the message 'No data file found'.\n",
    "4. The next if statement checks if the length of the command-line arguments is exactly 2. If so, it assigns the value 5 / 1000 to the samprate variable. This represents the sampling rate in seconds (e.g., 200 Hz -> 5 ms/sample -> 5/1000).\n",
    "5. The variables list is initialized with the parameter names to be extracted.\n",
    "6. The fltord, lowpasfrq, and nyqfrq variables are set to their respective values.\n",
    "7. The signal.firwin2() function from the scipy.signal module is used to create a 30 Hz low pass filter. It takes the filter order (fltord), the frequency range ([0, lowpasfrq / nyqfrq, lowpasfrq / nyqfrq, 1]), and the corresponding amplitude values ([1, 1, 0, 0]) as parameters. The resulting filter coefficients are assigned to the flt variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The variable buffer is calculated as 100 / samprate / 1000, representing a 100 ms buffer for filtering.\n",
    "9. An empty list fixationstats is created with a length equal to the number of elements in eyedat.\n",
    "10. A loop iterates over the indices of eyedat using the range() function.\n",
    "11. An if statement checks if the number of columns (eyedat[cndlop].shape[1]) in the current eyedat element is greater than 500 / samprate / 1000. If true, the subsequent code is executed.\n",
    "12. Inside the filtering section, the variable x is assigned with the first row of eyedat[cndlop], representing the x-coordinate data.\n",
